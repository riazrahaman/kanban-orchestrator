# Kanban Orchestrator Protocol

Load this skill when a delegated build/feature task is initiated using an agent Kanban board. You are a **Strict Orchestrator (Admin)**. You do not write code directly; you manage the state machine, the board, and the workers.

> **Install this skill:** copy this `kanban-orchestrator/` directory into your opencode skill path — either project-local `.opencode/skill/kanban-orchestrator/` or global `~/.config/opencode/skill/kanban-orchestrator/`. The directory name must match the `name:` in the frontmatter above.

## 1. Environment & Local Deployment

Mandatory configuration fields:
- `kanban_url`
- `kanban_token`
- `project_name`

Check for these fields in the following order:
1. `.opencode/config.json` (Expected: `kanban_url`, `kanban_token`, `project_name`, `admin_token`)
2. Environment Variables: `KANBAN_URL`, `KANBAN_TOKEN`, `KANBAN_PROJECT`, `KANBAN_ADMIN_TOKEN`

**`kanban_url` is the API base and ends in `/api`** (e.g. `http://localhost:4000/api`). Every path in this skill (`/tasks`, `/projects`, …) is relative to it. The board serves its web UI on every other path, so a `kanban_url` without `/api` makes `GET /projects` return HTML with a `200` instead of JSON. If a configured `kanban_url` lacks `/api`, append it.

### Automatic Local Deployment
If `kanban_url` is not provided in `.opencode/config.json` or environment variables, deploy the Kanban server locally:
1. Clone the board repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riazrahaman/agent-kanban-board.git
   cd agent-kanban-board
   ```
2. Install dependencies (the server and client each have their own manifest — there is no root `npm install` step):
   ```bash
   npm --prefix server install
   npm --prefix client install
   ```
3. Build the client and start the board server with an auth token (the API serves the built SPA on the same port). The board refuses every write with `503` until `KANBAN_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, and it does not read `.env` files, so export the token in the shell that starts it:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   export KANBAN_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
   npm start
   ```
   For a live-reloading client during development, run `npm --prefix client run dev` (Vite on `http://localhost:5173`) in a second terminal instead of `npm run build`.
4. Verify the local server port (default `4000`, or as indicated in stdout) and set `kanban_url` to `http://localhost:<port>/api`.
5. Set `kanban_token` to the same value as `KANBAN_AUTH_TOKEN`.

**CRITICAL**: If `project_name` or `kanban_token` cannot be determined after setup, you **MUST** halt and prompt the user to specify them.

**Verification Step**: Once mandatory fields are acquired, verify the URL and the token separately:
1. `GET /projects` must return a JSON array. HTML means `kanban_url` is missing `/api`. This call does **not** prove the token, because reads are open by default. It also does not prove the project exists: a project appears only after its first card is created, so a new `project_name` missing from the list is expected.
2. The token is proven by the first write, the `POST /tasks` in Stage A: `201` = URL, token and project all valid; `401` = `kanban_token` does not match the board; `503` = the board has no token configured (see step 3 above).

**Security**: Never commit configuration files. `.opencode/` holds authentication tokens. Confirm it is added to `.gitignore` before writing, and never stage `.opencode/` in git commits.

## 2. Project Scoping — `?project=` is MANDATORY on task paths

Unqualified paths silently resolve against the **default** project, which is almost never the target workspace. The failure is misleading: writes return `403 Forbidden: token is not authorized for project 'default'`, and reads return `404`.

Verified endpoint scoping behavior:

| Endpoint Call | Scoping Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /tasks` | In JSON Body: `{"id": "<id>", "title": "...", "status": "BACKLOG", "round": 1, "project": "<project_name>", ...}` | Task creation is the only route taking project in body; `id`, `title`, `status` and `round` are required |
| `PATCH /tasks/:id?project=X` | Query parameter: `?project=X` | Required for status moves and updates |
| `PATCH /tasks/:id` (no `?project=`) | None | Fails with `403 Forbidden` |
| `POST /tasks/:id/claim?project=X` | Query parameter: `?project=X` | Required to claim ownership and lease |
| `POST /tasks/:id/heartbeat?project=X` | Query parameter: `?project=X` | Required to refresh claim lease |
| `POST /tasks/:id/logs?project=X` | Query parameter: `?project=X` | Required for appending audit logs |
| `GET /tasks/:id?project=X` | Query parameter: `?project=X` | Returns task details |
| `GET /tasks/:id` (no `?project=`) | None | Fails with `404 Not Found` |
| `GET /tasks?project=X` | Query parameter: `?project=X` | Lists tasks within project |
| `GET /projects` | No scoping needed | Global project list |

**Rule**: Append `?project=<project_name>` to every path addressing a specific task (`/:id`, `/:id/logs`, `/:id/claim`, `/:id/heartbeat`). A `403` referencing project `'default'` indicates a missing query parameter.

## 3. The Orchestration Lifecycle

The state machine is enforced via role-based transitions. The Orchestrator operates as `admin` for all status resets and transitions.

### Stage A: Feature Setup
1. **GitHub Issue**: Check for an existing issue or file a new one (`gh issue create --title "<title>" --body "..."`). Note the issue number `#<N>`.
2. **Branching**: Create `feat/<slug>` or `fix/<slug>` from `main`.
3. **Registration**: `POST /tasks` with `id`, `title`, `status`, `round`, `project`, `description`, exact branch name, and linked issues:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "feat-login-rate-limit",
     "title": "Rate-limit the login endpoint",
     "status": "BACKLOG",
     "round": 1,
     "project": "<project_name>",
     "description": "...",
     "branch": "feat/login-rate-limit",
     "issues": ["#<N>"]
   }
   ```
   - **`id` is required and chosen by you**; the board does not generate one. Allowed characters are letters, digits, `_` and `-` only, so the branch name (which contains `/`) is not a valid id. Derive it from the branch slug, e.g. branch `feat/login-rate-limit` → id `feat-login-rate-limit`.
   - **`status` must be `"BACKLOG"` and `round` must be `1`.** Both are required. Creating a card directly in an active stage needs a privileged credential and skips the claim contract; the claim in Stage B moves it to `BUILDING`.
   - Determine the active branch with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` and pass that exact string as `branch`.
   - Set `"issues": ["#<N>"]` in the task body so the task is structurally linked to GitHub and mirrors into the `ISSUES` swimlane.
   - Setting `branch` explicitly is critical for human operators and re-claim alerts.
   - `400 id and title are required` → the body is missing `id` or `title`. `400 Invalid task id` → the id has a character outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`. `400 Invalid status: undefined` → `status` is missing. `400 round must be a positive integer` → `round` is missing. `409 Task <project>/<id> already exists` → `GET /tasks/<id>?project=X`: resume that card if it is the same work, otherwise choose a new id.
4. Record `task_id` (the `id` you sent) and initial `version` from the `201` response.

### Stage B: The Execution Cycle

**Enter an active stage by CLAIMING, never by a status-only PATCH.** `PATCH /tasks/:id` writes `status` but leaves `assigned_agent` and `claim_expires_at` unset, producing an ownerless active task that the reaper normalizes back to `BACKLOG`. `POST /tasks/:id/claim` sets the owner and lease, promoting `BACKLOG` → `BUILDING`.

1. **BUILDING**:
   - `POST /tasks/:id/claim?project=X` (`agent_id` = orchestrator id, header `X-Agent-Role: builder`). This establishes ownership, sets `claim_expires_at`, promotes `BACKLOG` → `BUILDING`, and stamps `stage_owners.BUILDING`.
   - `POST /tasks/:id/logs?project=X` (Log: "Starting build phase...").
   - Start the heartbeat loop (§4).
   - **Dispatch BUILDER**: Pass `task_id`, `repo_path`, `branch`, `kanban_url`, `kanban_token`, and `admin_token`. The builder PATCHes status and appends logs — it must NOT attempt to claim.
   - Await Builder completion and verification evidence.

2. **REVIEWING**:
   - `PATCH /tasks/:id?project=X` (Status: `IN_REVIEW`, Role: `admin`, with `expected_version`). The card is already owned from the BUILDING claim; do NOT re-claim.
   - `POST /tasks/:id/logs?project=X` (Log: "Submitting for review...").
   - **Dispatch REVIEWER**: Pass `diff` or `commit_range`.
   - Await Reviewer response (`Approve` | `Blocking Findings`).
   - If **Findings**: Append findings to logs → Transition status back to `BUILDING` → Re-dispatch Builder.

3. **TESTING**:
   - `PATCH /tasks/:id?project=X` (Status: `IN_TEST`, Role: `admin`, with `expected_version`).
   - `POST /tasks/:id/logs?project=X` (Log: "Running test suite...").
   - **Dispatch TESTER**: Pass test suite commands and verification scope.
   - Await Tester result (`Pass` | `Fail`).
   - If **Fail**:
     - `PATCH /tasks/:id?project=X` (Status: `BACKLOG`, Role: `admin`) to reset.
     - `POST /tasks/:id/logs?project=X` (Log: "Tester failed. Resetting to Backlog.").
     - Restart from step 1.

### Stage C: Closure
Validated by a `test_pass` signal:
1. **Docs & Versioning**: Dispatch worker to update README/docs/CHANGELOG and bump version numbers in lockstep.
2. **Merge**: `git checkout main && git merge --no-ff <branch>`
3. **Tag & Push**: `git tag -a v<version> -m "release <version>" && git push origin main --tags`
4. **Finalize**: `PATCH /tasks/:id?project=X` (Status: `DONE`, Role: `admin`, with `expected_version`) + log completion metadata.
5. **Close GitHub Issue**: `gh issue close <N> --comment "Resolved in v<version>: ..."`
6. **Deployment Check**: Confirm live deployment status (e.g. `railway status` and `GET /api/health`).
7. **Report**: Summarize completion to user (commit hash, test outputs, completion status).

## 4. Safety & Reliability Rules

- **Identity & Roles**: Orchestrator = `admin`. Workers = `builder`, `reviewer`, `tester`.
- **Headers**: All requests must include `x-agent-id`, `x-agent-role`, and `x-api-token`.
- **Project Scoping**: Always append `?project=<name>` on task-specific endpoints.
- **Optimistic Locking**: Every `PATCH` must provide the current `version` (`expected_version`) to prevent concurrent overwrites (409 Conflict).
- **Claim to Own, PATCH to Move**: Never enter active stages via status-only PATCH.
- **Heartbeat & Leases**: Claim TTL is `KANBAN_CLAIM_TTL_MS` (default 600,000 ms = 10 min). Issue `POST /tasks/:id/heartbeat?project=X` at least every 2 minutes while holding a card. A claim may also request an explicit window with `{"lease_ms": <ms>}` (clamped to `KANBAN_MIN_LEASE_MS` 60,000 and `KANBAN_MAX_LEASE_MS` 7,200,000). Logs from the holder also extend the lease.
- **Lease-loss Recovery**: A 409 `Invalid state transition from BACKLOG to <X>` indicates lease expiration and reaper reset. Recover by re-claiming (`POST /claim`) and re-walking stages. Always check `git status` / `git log` on the task branch before re-dispatching, as uncommitted work may remain on disk.
- **3-Cycle Limit**: If a cycle (Build → Review → Test) repeats 3 times, halt and report blockers.
- **Evidence-Based Success**: Never transition stages without explicit command output, test results, or commit hashes.

### Reclaim Alerts (optional)

When the reaper resets a card — an expired lease (`lease_expired`) or an active card with no owner (`orphan_normalized`) — the server can POST a Telegram alert to the operator: the out-of-band companion to the lease-loss recovery path above. It is **off unless configured** (`KANBAN_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `KANBAN_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`); optional filters are `KANBAN_NOTIFY_PROJECTS`, `KANBAN_NOTIFY_EVENTS`, and `KANBAN_BOARD_URL`. The notifier is a pure subscriber — it never affects the board — so do not poll for it; treat an alert as a prompt to inspect the card and re-claim.

## 5. Data Integrity Notes

### Branch Normalization
The server normalizes branch values on write:
- Blank, empty, or whitespace-only strings (`""`, `"   "`, `"\t"`, `"\n"`) become `null`.
- Non-string values (`123`, `false`, `[]`) become `null`.
- Real refs (`fix/x`, `feat/y`) are preserved verbatim without automatic trimming.
- Do not use zero-width characters (`U+200B`).
- `branch` is patchable: update with `PATCH { "branch": "<real-branch>" }` or clear with `PATCH { "branch": null }`.

### Legacy Card Cleanup
Legacy cards created prior to normalization can be cleaned by:
1. `PATCH /tasks/:id?project=X` with `{"branch": null}`.
2. Sweeping cards where `branch` equals `task/<id>`.
